# gorilla-game

Clone of the classic frogger game. Made completely with vanilla js, and no libraries. Sounds were taken from freesound.org.

The php file is just a little trick for deploying to heroku.

On a device with a keyboard, use the arrow keys to move the gorilla. On mobile and touch devices use the touch screen. There are some issues that need fixing with the touch controls on mobile safari, and when using a tablet on chrome.
